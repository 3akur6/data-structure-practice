## data structure practice   
code for homework but still be **fun**   

## Description

add some colorful display and animation in linux terminal

### binary tree
---

build binary tree from specified string   
output binary tree preorder, inorder, postorder, depth, amount of leaves

### complex
---

four fundamental rules of complex

### student table
---

a simple student table program which supports CRUD    
features:    
* give a user interface and colorful output
* use `readline.h` to strongly deal with user's input    
* add one or more items to database in smarter way    
* two editions: sequential list and linked list

### link list
---

divide lalpha, ualpha and numeric into three link lists   
features:    
* randomly generate test cases and also support change test case's length
* show node's memory location so that distinctly present the link structure

### hanoi
---

hanoi game solver using recursive algorithm    
features:    
* set solving steps apart in `hanoi_solve` API 
* use `ncurses.h` to show movement animation of disks in linux terminal

### palindrome
---

judge the palindrome string, apparently using stack structure

### sequential binary tree
---

basic sequential binary tree structure   
generate relationship randomly and display this in a form of several recessed bars
